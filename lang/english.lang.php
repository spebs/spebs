	SPEBS (System for Performance Evaluation of Broadband connections)
	is the Monitoring and Evaluation framework for broadband connections
	(xDSL services). The proposed system utilizes tools/functionality
	offered by Measurement-lab, in order to enable users, regulators
	as well as ISPs to draw conclusions regarding the quality of the
	delivered broadband services per country / globally.

Network Diagnostic Tool's primary purpose is to carry out end to end measurements on residential broadband connections as it incorporates functionality to approximately identify characteristics and evaluate performance of the user's broadband connection. Some of the most interesting network quality metrics observed by the Network Diagnostic Tool are upstream/downstream bandwidth (upload/download speed) to the user's pc, Round Trip Time (ping time) as well as the variation in the RTT (jitter) of individual packets and the percentage of packet loss. The architecture of NDT is based on the interaction of two distinct peers (a client: a java applet within a web browser and a measurement server) that evaluate the quality characteristics of the network path between them. The basic idea of this interaction is the following; the client and the measurement server exchange a predefined amount of network traffic and, based on timings of the exchanged packets the server calculates certain metrics pertaining to the quality of the link between them.

Following the appearance of the modified NDT java applet, the user may select Start Measurement. The measurement process is comprised of several distinct stages that can be identified at the progress bar. The basic measurement metrics such as upstream/downstream bandwidth (upload/download speed), RTT (ping time), RTT variation (jitter)  and packet loss, are registered during the completion of the various measurement stages. Average execution time of a typical NDT measurement varies from 30 to 60 seconds. The indication Measurement is complete at the progress bar follows the completion of every measurement. The end user at this stage can repeat the measurement process.

<li>

	<strong>Upstream/Downstream Bandwidth (Upload/Download speed)</strong> 
The specific metric provides an indication of the available bandwidth at the end user's pc. Bandwidth estimation is based on the entire client/server communication path. Increased downstream bandwidth allows for increased rate downloading. Along a communication path, the maximum traffic rate between the client and the server is constrained by the most congested link. Usually the most congested link for a typical ADSL end user is the access link to the broadband service provider. However, congestion on backhaul links along the communication path is also possible and will be reflected at the measurement. 
</li>

<li>

	<strong>Round Trip Time (Ping time)</strong> 
The RTT is the time needed for a packet originating from the broadband host to the measurement server increased by the time needed for the server to respond to the host. Regarding RTT calculation both the broadband host and the measurement server can be used as origin/destination irrespectively. RTT is a very significant performance evaluation metric. An increased value of RTT could lead to increased delay for applications such as interactive network games, Internet telephony (VoIP, Skype etc). The average value off RTT is calculated from a predefined number of tests on both directions. 

</li>

<li>

	<strong>Packet Loss</strong> 
Packet loss is calculated along the round trip paths from the MLAB measurement server to remote broadband hosts. Values around 1% indicate serious disruptions in the service.
</li>

<li>

	<strong>RTT variation (Jitter)</strong> 
RTT variation measures how spread are the RTT values around the average e.g. an RTT variation of 3 milliseconds indicates the difference between minimum and maximum calculated RTT values. The metric is also an indicator of possible disruptions in the service, however it must be noted that since extreme values are taken into consideration it is not a safe performance evaluation metric.

<p class=\"paragraph1\"><a href=\"http://broadband.mpi-sws.org/transparency/bttest.php\">Glasnost</a> enables users to detect if they are subject to traffic differentiation. Glasnost is unique in its focus on users. Instead of providing only a broad characterization of differentiation in the Internet it allows individual users determine if they experience differentiation and quantify its impact at the time they use Glasnost.

<p class=\"paragraph1\"> Traffic differentiation refers to an ISP treating the packets of one flow differently than those of another flow, i.e., belonging to different applications. Glasnost detects traffic differentiation which is performed  based on the type of the flow. In order to differentiate between flows of different types, ISPs usually distinguish the packets of the various flows by examining one of the following: i. the IP header (source or destination addresses) ii. The transport protocol header (e.g. port numbers) and iii. the application based on  packet payload via performing deep-packet inspection. Glasnost detects traffic differentiation that is triggered by transport protocol headers (e.g., ports) or packet payload.

<p class=\"paragraph1\">Glasnost is an active measurements tool which is based on a client-server architecture. Clients connect to a Glasnost server to download and run various tests. Each test measures the path between the client and the server by generating flows that carry application-level data. This data is carefully constructed to detect traffic differentiation along the path. 

<p class=\"paragraph1\">For each test, Glasnost carries out 8 distinct test repetitions, 4 in the upload and 4 in the download direction. Of the 4 tests for each direction, 2 are carried out over the well known port of the protocol being tested and 2 over a random port. Each of these 2 pairs includes a transfer that matches the data flow of the protocol being tested and a control flow transfer that does not match it. Thus, Glasnost tests all possible combinations of flow patterns and port numbers to detect throttling that is based either on port number detection or even deeper packet inspection.

<strong>Ε1:</strong> How accurate are the NDT measurement results?
<br/>

<strong>Α1:</strong>
The NDT tool provides an approximation of the measured metrics. The quality of the estimated values can be affected by other applications running at the user's PC or at the LAN as well as temporary problems encountered on the network path to the server. The user is advised to perform the measurement on a idle broadband connection. 
<br/>
<br/>

Broadband measurement tools selected by EETT provide an estimation of broadband connections quality. The results are presented impartially with the goal to inform broadband subscribers on the market of broadband connections. EETT can not guaranty the accuracy of the measurements that depends on multiple external factors beyond the control of the national regulation authority. The user is responsible for correct and sufficient use of the provided tools. EETT is not responsible for any problems that may arise from the use of the broadband measurement tools.
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">

<strong>Ε2:</strong> Can the measurement be performed from a WiFi connected PC?
<br/>

<strong>Α2:</strong>
Depending on the 802.11 flavour, the bandwidth is constrained by the bandwidth of the wireless medium. In the case of 802.11b, depending on the signal strength, bandwidth varies from 11Mbps, 5.5Mbps, 2Mbps or 1Mbps. Moreover, due to the wireless environment the measurement results may indicate that a half duplex connection is used. Therefore it is suggested to perform the measurement on a PC directly connected to the modem/router. 
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">

<strong>Ε3:</strong> Which are the parameters that affect the quality of a measurement?
<br/>

<strong>Α3:</strong> Firewalls filtering traffic, high load at the measurement server or cabling related problems may affect the quality of the broadband connection. 
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">

<strong>Ε4:</strong> Do the measurement results include data overhead (eg from TCP/IP headers)?
<br/>

<strong>Α4:</strong> No, bandwidth value is not calculated with protocol overhead.
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">

<strong>Ε5:</strong> Can the nominal data rate be achieved? For example if the user purchases a 24 Mbps DSL service, can the results of the measurement (download speed) reach that value?   
<br/>

<strong>A5:</strong> Every utilized protocol (TCP,IP,PPP etc) adds overhead to the data transfer. Therefore measurement results are always less than the nominal data rate.
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">

<strong>Ε6:</strong> What is the overhead in data transfer over a broadband line? 
<br/>

<strong>A6:</strong> It depends on the specifics of the broadband connection (e.g. protocols used). 
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">

<strong>Ε7:</strong> Which is the transport protocol used by NDT? 
<br/>

<strong>A7:</strong> NDT utilizes TCP as implemented by the server. TCP connections are established between the client and the measurements server.  
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">

<strong>Ε8:</strong> How is RTT, packet loss and RTT variation calculated?
<br/>

<strong>Α8:</strong> 
NDT utilizes TCP RTT estimation function (Van Jacobson: Congestion avoidance and control. SIGCOMM 1988).Jitter calculation is based on the TCP RTT estimation and is defined as the difference between extreme RTT values. Retransmited packets contribute to packet loss estimation. 
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">
<strong>Ε9:</strong>Glasnost communicates with the measurement server over which ports? 
<br>
<strong>Α9:</strong>Over TCP port 3001 for control purposes, while the actual measurement is neing done over the well-known port of the service that the user has chosen to test for traffic shaping. Specifically, bittorrent: 6881, eMule: 4662, Gnutela 6346, POP:110, IMAP4:143, HTTP: 80, SSH: 22, Flash Video: 8080. 
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">
<strong>Ε10:</strong>Why Glasnost measurements take approx. 8 minutes while NDT finishes in 30 seconds? 
<br>
<strong>Α10:</strong>Glasnost needs to do multiple tests using different traffic profiles to ascertain whether there are differences in the way the network behaves. Simply put, the two tools serve a completely different purpose, hence their differences. 
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">
<strong>Ε11:</strong>Can I use Glasnost over WiFi; 
<br>
<strong>Α11:</strong>Yes. With Glasnost what is of interest is not the measurement of bandwidth itself but the differences among many measurements. Given the fact that all the measurements are being carried out over the same link, ideally when there is no traffic shaping all measurements should yield approximately the same value. 
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">
<strong>Ε12:</strong>Any factors negatively affecting the Glasnost measurement accuracy? 
<br>
<strong>Α12:</strong>Like with NDT, anything producing network traffic while the measurement is being carried out. Other additional negative factors can be seen in question #3 above.
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">
<strong>Ε13:</strong>How accurate is the Glasnost measurement? 
<br>
<strong>Α13:</strong>Even though under ideal circumstances the measurements should always yield the correct picture, there are cases where the bandwidth for the download or upload direction can be erroneously reported as being shaped. Therefore, it is recommended to systematically repeat the same measurements (e.g. 3 distinct tests approx. the same time every day for 3 consecutive days) to get a really strong indication whether the upload or download direction for a protocol is indeed being shaped. 
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">
<strong> E14:</strong> How is the nearest local exchange determined?
<br>
<strong>A14:</strong> For urban areas in Athens and Salonika, the exact polygons surrounding the area serviced by each exchange are used. Consequently, every connection can be safely assigned to the exchange that is actually being used. For the rest of the country, selection of the nearest exchange is hitherto based on the absolute geographocal distance. 
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">
<strong> E15:</strong>How is the distance to the nearest exchange calculated? 
<br>
<strong>A15:</strong>The approximate distance to the nearest exchange is calculated according to the geographical coordinates of the exchange and the user connection location. Cable lines usually track the existing road infrastructure, thus the distance is not calculated based on the geographical distance but is approximated by summing the vertical and horizontal differences between the two locations.
</p>

<p class=\"paragraph1\">
<strong> E16:</strong> How is the the maximum theoretical speed calculated for ADSL and VDSL connections?
<br>
<strong>A16:</strong> The maximum theoretical distance is calculated according to the following tables:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Your measurements are recorded and displayed on the map, only if you have previously registered and logged in to the application. A minimum of three (3) measurements is required. Registered users gain access to their own measurements history and personalized statistics.</li>
<li>It is recommended to directly connect you computer to the modem/router, using Ethernet cable connection. Wireless network (WiFi) may limit performance of your connection.</li>
<li>Before starting a measurement, make sure your broadband connection is not used by other types of software, computer or network device (e.g. IPTV decoder, security camera, torrents, etc). Network traffic generated by such sources may reduce accuracy of your measurement results.</li>
<li>In order to use the NDT, M-Lab Notifier and Glasnost measurement tools you may need to:</li>
<ol>
<li>install the latest version of Java available at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://java.com\">Java.com</a>,
following the directions found there,</li>
<li>accept the usage of the NDT and Glasnost applets when asked by your web browser or your operating system</li>
<li>accept and allow NDT and Glasnost to communicate with the internet when asked by your system's firewall software.</li>
</ol>

<li> SPEBS uses the M-Lab measurement platform, which aytomatically assigns each measurement to the closest available
measurement server. When the country's all available servers are busy, your measurement may be conducted by a server located
in another country. In that case, if you are logged in, the results of your measurement will not be saved in your profile.</li>
